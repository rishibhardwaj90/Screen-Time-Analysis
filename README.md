📱 Screen Time Analysis with Python
This project aims to analyze user screen time behavior across various apps using Python. It provides insights into daily app usage, interaction frequency, and the impact of notifications on user activity.

📊 Project Overview
The analysis is based on a synthetic dataset that includes:
- Date
- App name
- Usage time (minutes)
- Notifications received
- Times opened

🔍 Key Features
- Visual trends of app usage over time
- Pairplot analysis of usage, notifications, and app opens
- Summary statistics and weekly usage patterns
- Average behavior per app (usage, notifications, and times opened)
- Probability analysis of user response to notifications

📁 Files
- resume_project_codes.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing all the code, visualizations, and analysis.

🛠️ Libraries Used
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn

📌 Insights
- Instagram showed the highest screen time and responsiveness.
- Netflix has high usage but fewer interactions.
- WhatsApp had the most notifications but moderate usage.
- All apps had a 100% open rate upon receiving notifications.

📈 Sample Visualizations
- Line plots for screen time trends
- Bar charts for average usage per day
- Pairplots showing feature relationships
